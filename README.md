# Brainfuck Compiler From Scratch!

### **This documentation is a work in progress. Please be patient as I actually work on this**

Currently this program only creates an executable which prints out the link to Rick Astley's hit song Never Gonna Give You Up.

TODO:
- Make the load and store all work with the SIB byte thingy
- Take inputs from user
- uhhh actually write the interpreter i think

## Build instructions

In order to compile the project in Linux:

```bash
make
```

And in order to run:

```
make run
```

Very simple.

By default, the executable generated is `output`, and you can run it after running the compiler to see the link to find the love of your life. Click the link. Try it.
